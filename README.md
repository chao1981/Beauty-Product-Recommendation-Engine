6 weeks project (including Fletcher):

Goal : Beauty product recommendation.

       1) Get Amazon Data 
       
       2) Create a better sorting algorithm 
         (based on number of stars : Laplace transformation, and weight 1-start review heavier)
       
       3) Build product-user-profile : skin type and sensitivity
              Natural Language processing : TF-IDF, Document Summarization, 
                                          Sentiment Analysis Graph (vs Star-Graph)
       
       4) Build an application where the user can type in specify requirement for the product. 
       		Based on text comparison, return a maximum of 3 products as recommendations.
       		
       5) Put a sentiment Graph to show how well the product performs over time.
       
       6) Make an app up and running on AWS
