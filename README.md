6 weeks project (including Fletcher):

Goal : Beauty product recommendation.

       1) Get Amazon Data and Nordstrom Data
       
       2) Create a better sorting algorithm 
         (based on number of stars : Laplace transformation, and weight 1-start review heavier)
       
       3) Natural Language processing : TF-IDF, Document Summarization, Sentiment Analysis Graph (vs Star-Graph)
              * Build product-user-profile : skin type and sensitivity
       
       
       4) Build an application where the user can type in specify requirement for the product. 
       		Based on text comparison, return a maximum of 3 products as recommendations.

UP AND RUNNING : Beauty3.ninja

Website name explained: 

beauty3 : We only recommend 3 beauty products at a times (yay, no overwhelming amounts of products)

.ninja  : Because just as ninja, we are highly skilled and precise.
(secretly, as always come with "ninja", is because it's awesome :D)
